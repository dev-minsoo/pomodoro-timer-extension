- Skip step (jump to next session)

**Expected Impact**

- Improves pacing and focus continuity

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Priority**: High

- Supports diverse working styles

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Priority**: Medium

## 3) UI/UX Improvements
**Ideas**

- Current session info (e.g., session count)
- Compact/minimal UI mode
- Keyboard shortcuts

**Expected Impact**

## 4) Logging & Analytics
**Ideas**

**Difficulty**: High  
**Priority**: Medium–Low

## 5) Optional Extensions

- Data export (CSV/JSON)

**Expected Impact**
- Extends into a productivity suite
- Higher satisfaction for power users

**Difficulty**: High  
**Priority**: Low

## Next Decisions
- Whether to include long breaks and cycle tracking in the MVP
- Storage model needed if analytics are added
- Prioritize UI improvements vs feature expansion
